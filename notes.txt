Game goal and idea, from a story perspective.

Playable character (PC) is suffering from depression, and needs to balance mood with progression. At times, they may suffer from a bad day, with low "spoons" available. At such times, the companion may become slightly frustrated with the PC, first asking them to hurry up, then noting that the slowdown is not characteristic of them, and finally "What's wrong with you? You were running just fine yesterday, but we've barely made progress today!"

Companion is not without sympathy, but is fairly results-oriented and has good relationships with many friends. Unless player is very skilled or has made a particular chain of choices, they leave the PC with little thought, thinking that everyone in the world has a support network and thus the PC will be fine without them. They are clearly extroverted, and absorb the good vibes from their surroundings, having a bit of difficulty understanding introversion or depression.

Straining.

Running really fast for a long period of time puts strain on the body. At some point after reaching a high speed and running for a while without rest, the main character starts accumulating strain. With strain, first the screen starts periodically getting -30 mood pulses every 2-3 seconds (like heartbeat), then at shorter intervals and accompanied with sound effects, and finally the character "breaks", the screen goes deep red for a moment and starts fading back. Permanent -30 mood penalty, and one of the buttons the player had is randomly disabled.

The player can recover one of the disabled buttons by resting for 1 day (but be left with mood penalty), or avoid getting any penalty by resting for 2 days. However, time is precious...

This system makes the game more dynamic, and makes the player think about straining themselves too much despite their important (?) goal. Strain event should be dramatic and scary, to heighten the emotional impact. The sound effects are crucial.

Just like in real life, injuries can also be immediate and surprising. They may leave a permanent disability, leading to a mood impact due to slow progress. This should be shocking to players, and put them to reconsider their attitude towards topics of safety and disability.


Competitions / items.

Every now and then, main character will come across items with random stats a la Diablo etc. These items will have fairly strong and varied effects, changing gameplay strategies with their combinations. Each item should have a strong upside, with a moderate-high downside. Up to three items can be equipped at once, and the items can be sold for money (!). Finding great combinations is one of the key interests.

There can also be running competitions with various goals, e.g. longest distance in a given time or shortest time for a given distance, with or without energy replenishment, with periodic energy replenishment, with or without weights (passive, absolute number penalty to speed), etc. Using items to win money at these events can be of strategic interest. Player may also be interested in trade-off of selling an item to get immediate cash, since future competitions may or may not require the item.

Item effects may also include faster recovery of specific actions. Faster recovery of "step forward" is particularly valuable.

Core gameplay is as follows.

The game is about balancing moving forward, manging your mood, and making sure you don't run out of energy. This is accomplished be exchanging each resource for others in a fairly controlled but somewhat unpredictable way. The game should not be frustrating, but provide food for thought; the idea is that through their interpretation of the game mechanics, the player may gain insight about their own lives or of those around them. A core idea is that the main character is highly introverted, while their companion is extroverted.

Energy - spend by moving forward and being social, replenished by rest and being alone.
Mood - spend by not making progress or through events, gain by being social or through events.
Fatigue - spend through time, gain by spending money on food. Affects energy use.
Sleep - lose mood if sleeping in poor conditions, gain mood if sleeping in good conditions (risk/reward thinking, paying money for a premium)

Essentially, not moving forward will conserve energy at the cost of mood, while moving forward and interacting with the world costs energy but improves mood. Furthermore, mood has three types, which the player can influence through their choices. These mood changes have various effects on the events that the player will come across, as well as their relation with the companion.

The idea is to provide cognitive dissonance through the breakup with the companion character; a "loving/emotional" player will come across heartbreak through poverty/disease (prompting them to be rational), a "generous" player will come across heartbreak through perceived clinginess and poor relationship balance/dynamic (prompting them to be emotional), and a "rational" player will have to choose between money or the companion (prompting them to be generous). A "calculative", super efficient player will have the choice between a few extra stat points and mood immunity, but they need to harm the environment with gradually more impactful selfish acts, eventually killing the companion to achieve the highest performance. The main character will question their choices ("what was it all for..?"), and ultimately take their own life.

The general "goal" is to advance through the game, moving forward as much as possible each day. Low mood acts as a multiplier for energy consumption, which encourages to move forward, but this is kept in check by increasing fatigue and mood loss multiplier when too much is happening in a short time. In other words, the player character gets exhausted if they encounter constant social situations, despite it being beneficial for mood in the short term.

Another goal is to control hunger and lodging; by sleeping outside with a hungry stomach, one naturally loses a lot of mood. On the other hand, searching for food or paying for accommodation costs time and money respectively. Money can be gained by trading real-world time for money, the rate and maximum amount of which depends on location.

One day in-game takes around two to ten minutes to go through, with a 20-50 sec cutscene. With 30 days, the whole game takes about 150-200 minutes. Endings are varied and depend on general mood and choices.

Remove merchant elements unless it's crucial to core gameplay - if the game can't stand without them, it's not engaging enough. Consider towns and merchant stuff only after completing the main thing.

Perhaps key items should be separate from merchantable/single-use items. If so, separate item space into tabs that transition left-to-right if tabs on top, up-to-down if tabs on left edge (would be interesting UI, although less intuitive UX? Also horiz space is the bottleneck.)

For events and whether to pause gameplay - energy is consumed as normal, and the game can be considered "paused" once that happens (after sufficient unlocks). Change tab title to *** EVENT *** as in A Dark Room whenever a pop-up happens. Pop-ups could have a variable defining whether they should pause movement or not. Meetings and towns should (unless turned off/ignored by player??), while finding resources should simply be noted in menu. As for UX, text fadeoff is implemented as static alpha mask in ADR, that is probably the best since it does not require constant watching. Prepend private variables/classmembers/constants with an underscore, and add jQuery for easier class handling.

In order to make core gameplay more interesting, we could add emphasis on step back, etc. Make the player character feel how he becomes accustomed to the running, and what kinds of things he notices after becoming more fit and emotionally stable. Also make player wonder about what the road is about. Is this the road of life? What am I making progress towards? Am I trying to get somewhere, or running from something? Is this path the right one? What am I trying to accomplish, anyway? Is this road leading somewhere? Is there any meaning to this? Am I moving forwards, or backwards? Which way does this road take me? ...Am I getting over her, or simply wallowing in pain (conclusion dependent on mood, possibly)? Is there something else I could do? (productivity +10, wrt Novin viesti, maybe unlock the unlockability of on-rest activities)?


Unlock UI one-by-one by stepping forward, but what would be useful/interesting to unlock? What is the downside of unlocking something? Is it possible to press the button and not unlock anything? What in-theme message could be displayed if user tries to repeatedly unlock things? At what timing is the relationship of mood and energy displayed? Less details at first, can give more exact info even about the same items. (little vs 15 vs 15 (+2/sec))

When does mood change? Specifically, what increases it? Hearing the girl talk? Does the girl always talk when she has something to say and you take a rest? Does taking a rest reduce mood or energy gain if girl says nothing? What makes you want to try harder in life? ...Under consideration.

Will the ending be fixed at 20-40 days, or will the game continue until some kind of closure is reached? I guess mood drops could be more frequent if no hope is in sight, leading to exhaustion, no energy, no progress, and eventually to either suicide or death from overexertion.

Will food/shelter be mandatory? Does the protagonist figure out that they are carrying supplies, without noticing at first (due to low mood and no steps back)? Shelter should impact mood, food obiously would be interesting due to energy vs time/money and planning tradeoffs but requires lots of management and separate tracking of hunger. What about spoilage? One dynamically interesting solution would be to have "general ration" items, which are consumed twice per day. This forces the player to estimate risk, and eating takes a long time to finish. Description: "Bland but filling rations, containing (vegetable paste/food-edible/prepareable-on-the-go, something without spoiling) and water."

What is the opening story of the game? The protagonist has travelled back in time, exhausted and only knowing that they must keep moving forward. Why? Because in previous timeline, they knew that they could reach/re-meet the girl if they move forward fast enough to catch up. The time travel is rough, and causes fatigue, depression, and amnesia until a certain amount of time has passed. Then you remember everything - that you travelled through time, witnessing a plethora of possibilities unravel before your eyes. Running back to the starting point to find your time machine, you decide to give future another shot (resetting the game, but again either you or the girl die; there is no changing what is meant to happen (suddenly wtf this is like steins gate lol)).

IF you decide to give the player an out from the grip of fate, implement it late and only after the best of ideas. Don't let it be half-assed or incomplete, or emotionally easy - make it the highlight for the type of player who would super-optimize everything, and force them to never pick up the game ever again. Don't cut things to please them, though - you need to cater to the 99.2% audience first.

Is the game always in initial state, or is there "prestige"? I guess the player could unlock "cheats", e.g. a 2x speed mode after completion (ADR hyper mode implemented as simply cutting cooldowns in two). However, why not make that available to all as accessibility settings? (Actually good idea)

Is there a high score list or something, to track amount of steps taken by player? No, but there is a VERY BAD ENDING for players who try to over-optimize everything. Think in the vein of Mother 2 cheater mode or Undertale G-route.

Are the main characters genderless? That is should the girl be written as your ideal girl, but referred to as "companion" and "they" in all instances in-game? The meeting would be the hardest, but maybe... "They are strikingly beautiful, and you immediately feel a twinge of attraction towards this person." Need to think about this, but it would require rendering protagonist genderless too. Quite possibly a good thing; just don't let it affect the writing of the characters themselves, their integrity must not be compromised.

Don't allow the game to be such that one plays it and thinks "it's nice, but not sure what the point is..."; ensure the girl and hook is so engaging that people will want to know what happens next ("no! what about the girl?? what happened? I need to know how this thing turns out ;__; ")

Green route (meet girl, go together, happy lives, good ending, standard for 1st playthrough)

Blue route (merchant)

Red route (lovesick, "bad" i.e. best ending):
You see a person in the distance.
The person looks like a young woman, perhaps in her early 20s.
She is just standing there. You wonder who she is.
You approach the girl, and she asks whether she could accompany you. You agree.

(if moving at high speed)
The both of you are moving at a fast pace. She seems to have a bit of difficulty keeping up with the pace.
You are forging on, and she is starting to lose breath. Perhaps it is time for a rest.
It is clear this girl is slowing you down a bit.
The young woman is holding you back. Will you move ahead without her? (y/n)

(if changing speeds/taking two rests)
After resting, she seems to have regained her energy.
Taking a break seems to have improved her stamina.
(After steps forward) While she has less physical strength, she is clearly getting more with each rest.

(she catches up to you, non-insane speed)
A girl catches up with you. She says: Well, I certainly don't see many people here! Where are you hea-- ...Wait, are you the person I met earlier? ...Hahaha. What a coincidence! I've learnt from our previous encounter, and have much better endurance now. Mind if I tag along? I won't slow you down again, promise. (y/n)

(she catches up to you, insane speed)
Someone is approaching. You feel the ground tremble.
Girl: Hey... There... You... Are...
I've been running non-stop for a while now, and finally caught up.

It's.. Um... Sorry. I don't mean that I chased after you. It's just... After our encounter, I couldn't stop thinking about you... So I decided to become faster than you, no matter what it takes, and catch up!

...How are you doing? Must be pretty lonely here, huh? ...Ha ha.

(She never catches up)
... The player is an emotionless super-optimizer, this should require multiple playthroughs to pull off.


(if moving at very slow speed, or taking multiple breaks (harder to achieve, second-fourth playthrough thing, kind of hinted by above))
Girl: Are you tired as well?
We still have a long way to go. Let's keep moving.
Look, we have to keep moving.
Can't you hurry up a bit?
I understand that you are tired, but can you step it up?
...
...
Look, I need to get to my next destination faster than this. What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
...Sorry, but I'll be leaving you behind if you continue at this pace.
...
Sorry, but I really need to go ahead. Do your best now, OK? (The girl picks up the pace and leaves you behind.)
(You wonder if you will meet with the girl again, somewhere.)
(She seemed to have urgent business, and you can't help wondering why she was in a hurry.)
(She seemed kind of cute, too... You wonder where she went.)
(You can't stop thinking about that girl.)
(...)
(...)
(The girl is still bothering you. Who was she? Why did she tag along despite being in a hurry?)
(...)
(You wish you could have done something for her.)


(You catch up, medium speed)
Encounter as traders, she doesn't remember you, rejection, deep depression and continue forever with low mood

(You catch up, insane speed)
(She is dead, and you go back in time)

(You never catch up [exceed day 40])
(You commit suicide)
